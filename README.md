# "Jump Froggy" is a game where the goal is to get a frog from one side of a pond to the other by jumping on lily pads. 
The frog can only jump forward, and each lily pad has a number representing the points gained by landing on it. The objective is to maximize the total points by choosing the best sequence of jumps.

# In a greedy optimization approach for "Jump Froggy," the frog always chooses the immediate jump that gives the highest points, regardless of future consequences.
Here's a step-by-step description of how this strategy works:

# Initialization:
The frog starts at the first lily pad.
# Look Ahead: 
For each possible jump, the frog looks at the points of the lily pads it can jump to.
# Select Jump: 
The frog jumps to the lily pad with the highest points among the immediate options.
# Repeat: 
The frog repeats steps 2 and 3 until it reaches the end of the pond or no more jumps are possible.
